# üè• Stroke Detection Application - Beginner's Guide

## üìã What You Need Before Starting
- A computer with **Python** installed (version 3.8 or newer)
- Basic familiarity with using the **terminal/command prompt**
- **10-15 minutes** for first-time setup
- **Internet connection** for downloading packages

## üêç Installing Python (If You Don't Have It)

### Check if Python is Already Installed
1. Open terminal (see Step 1 below for how)
2. Type: `python --version` or `python3 --version`
3. If you see something like "Python 3.x.x", you're good to go!

### If Python is Not Installed:

**Windows:**
1. Go to [python.org](https://python.org)
2. Click "Download Python" (latest version)
3. Run the installer
4. **IMPORTANT**: Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
5. Restart your computer

**Mac:**
1. Go to [python.org](https://python.org)
2. Download Python for macOS
3. Run the installer
4. Or use Homebrew: `brew install python`

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv
```

## üÜï First Time Setup on a New Computer

If this is your first time setting up this application on a new computer, follow these steps:

### Option A: Download the Application Files

1. **Get the application files** from your source (USB drive, email, cloud storage, etc.)
2. **Extract/Copy** all files to a folder on your computer
3. **Remember the folder location** - you'll need this path later

### Option B: If You Have Git (Advanced Users)
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd stroke-detection
```

### Create Python Virtual Environment
Once you have the files on your computer:

1. **Open terminal** and navigate to your application folder:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/stroke-detection
   ```
   > Replace `/path/to/your/stroke-detection` with the actual folder path

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv stroke_prediction_env
   ```
   ‚è±Ô∏è **Wait time**: This takes 1-2 minutes

3. **Activate the environment**:
   - **Linux/Mac**: `source stroke_prediction_env/bin/activate`
   - **Windows**: `stroke_prediction_env\Scripts\activate`

4. **Install all required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install flask numpy pandas scikit-learn xgboost seaborn matplotlib openpyxl
   ```
   ‚è±Ô∏è **Wait time**: This takes 3-5 minutes

‚úÖ **Setup Complete!** You only need to do this once per computer.

## üöÄ How to Start the Application (After Setup)

### Step 1: Open Your Terminal
- **Windows**: Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, press Enter
- **Mac**: Press `Cmd + Space`, type `Terminal`, press Enter  
- **Linux**: Press `Ctrl + Alt + T`

### Step 2: Navigate to the Application Folder
Copy and paste this command, then press Enter (replace with your actual path):
```bash
cd /path/to/your/stroke-detection
```
> **Example paths:**
> - Windows: `cd C:\Users\YourName\stroke-detection`
> - Mac/Linux: `cd /home/username/stroke-detection`

### Step 3: Activate the Python Environment
This prepares Python to run our application:
- **Linux/Mac**: `source stroke_prediction_env/bin/activate`
- **Windows**: `stroke_prediction_env\Scripts\activate`

‚úÖ **Success indicator**: You should see `(stroke_prediction_env)` at the start of your command line

### Step 4: Go to the Application Code
```bash
cd CODE
```

### Step 5: Install Required Software Packages
This downloads all the tools our application needs:
```bash
pip install flask numpy pandas scikit-learn xgboost seaborn matplotlib
```
‚è±Ô∏è **Wait time**: This may take 2-3 minutes to complete

### Step 6: Start the Application
```bash
python app.py
```

üéâ **Success!** You should see messages like:
- "XAI Engine ready for explanations!"
- "Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000"

### Step 7: Open the Application in Your Browser
Click this link or copy it to your web browser:
**http://127.0.0.1:5000**

## üåê What Can This Application Do?

### üè† Main Pages You Can Visit
Once the app is running, you can access these pages in your browser:

1. **Home Page**: http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   - Main landing page with information about the app

2. **Individual Prediction**: http://127.0.0.1:5000/prediction
   - Enter a person's health information to predict stroke risk
   - Get instant results with explanations

3. **Admin Login**: http://127.0.0.1:5000/login
   - Username: `admin@gmail.com`
   - Password: `admin`
   - Access data upload features

4. **Data Upload**: http://127.0.0.1:5000/upload (after login)
   - Upload Excel or CSV files with multiple patients' data
   - Process many predictions at once

### üéØ What the App Does (In Simple Terms)
- **Predicts stroke risk** for individuals based on health factors like age, blood pressure, etc.
- **Explains why** it made that prediction (using AI explanation technology)
- **Risk levels**: Gives results from LOW risk to EXTREME risk
- **Processes files**: Can analyze data for many people at once from spreadsheet files

## ‚èπÔ∏è How to Stop the Application

When you're done using the app:

## üîß Common Problems and Solutions

### Problem 1: "Virtual environment doesn't work"
**What to do:**
```bash
python3 -m venv stroke_prediction_env
source stroke_prediction_env/bin/activate
```
This creates a fresh Python environment.

### Problem 2: "Can't install packages" 
**What to do:** Install them one by one:
```bash
pip install flask
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install scikit-learn
pip install xgboost
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
```

### Problem 3: "Address already in use" or "Port 5000 busy"
**What this means:** Another program is using the same web address
**What to do:**
1. Open the file `app.py` in a text editor
2. Find the last line that says: `app.run(debug=True)`
3. Change it to: `app.run(debug=True, port=5001)`
4. Save the file and run the app again
5. Now visit: http://127.0.0.1:5001 instead

### Problem 4: "Python not found" 
**What to do:**
- Make sure Python is installed on your computer
- Try using `python3` instead of `python` in commands
- Download Python from [python.org](https://python.org) if needed

## üìÅ What's Inside This Application
- **app.py** - The main program that runs everything

## üí° Tips for Beginners
- **Copy commands exactly** - Don't change spacing or punctuation
- **Wait for commands to finish** - Some steps take time, be patient
- **Keep terminal open** - Don't close it while the app is running
